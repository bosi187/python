#Shyam has decided to buy a computer. The shopkeeper said that the main memory, RAM is available in GBs. But Shyam only knew calculation in MBS and he has to tell his father how many MB he is buying so that his father will pay him accordingly. Shyam remembered that 1 GB = 1024 MB as per his teacher. What will be the size of RAM in MBS if the shopkeeper say that RAM size is 10 GB? 
 
ram=int (input ("ram of pc ")) 
GB=1024*ram
